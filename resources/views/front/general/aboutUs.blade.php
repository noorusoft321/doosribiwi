		                <p>In truth, this precious bond between two individuals is what brings the peace and happiness in human kind. The ultimate happiness of finding and living with the right person is almost divine. To share every thought without words, to feel every emotion mutually, to celebrate mental and spiritual connection is a thing of rarity. In our society, young men and women are not allowed to choose their own life partners and matchmaking for marriages is initiated by the elders of the family. It is considered close to almost indecent for wishing to even take a look at the bride/groom before marriage. And thus, we witness an element of frustration building in couples nowadays. </p>
