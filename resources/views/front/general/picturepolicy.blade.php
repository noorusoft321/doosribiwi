	{{--Much similar to social media networks, Shaadi.org.pk also allows its members to upload as many pictures as they like in order to increase their chances of finding a good suitorto get rishta online in Pakistan. The photos uploaded by a member can be seen by other existing members during two occasions. One, whenever the member’s profile is being viewed by another member. Two, the picture will be apparent whenever the member’s name or profile shows up in the search results page of our matrimonial portal.--}}

							In order to give every profile its own unique identity, every member profile has an option for a mandatory profile picture. This picture will be the one that will mostly appear everywhere on the website including the search results. A photo gallery is also present for every member to use. Members can upload as many pictures they like as and when for other interested members to view. However, privacy settings can be changed in order to limit viewing privileges of those Shaadi members who stumble upon your profile.
