					    <h2><u><strong>Safety and Security</strong></u></h2>
					    <p>Many individuals today use online matrimonial services to find a suitable match for themselves from the comfort of their homes. While this is a great trend, many cases of fraud and of people who misuse such matrimonial sites are also reported. In order to help you have a safe experience, we have a compiled a guide on how to remain cautious – take a look!</p>
					    <h3>Refrain from Giving Money to Someone You Find on the Internet</h3>
					    <p>At times, you may come across certain profiles that click with you and the individual approaches you, indulges in sweet talk, and makes false promises to make you fall for them. What’s the catch? They will never agree to a video chat or they won’t give truthful answers to your questions. What you don’t realize is that they are using cheap tactics to play with your feelings to try and trap you. They may be impersonating someone else by using their pictures too. In extreme cases, these malicious individuals find ways to ask you for money by making up fake sob stories about how they need the cash urgently to get something done. If you give them the amount they demand out of pity or love, they disappear like a ghost and you never see them again. So never, EVER, let money get involved.</p>
					    <h3>Say a Big NO to Physical Relationships Before Marriage</h3>
					    <p>Islam strictly prohibits any kind of physical relationship before marriage – it is a highly sinful act. Don’t ever indulge in such an act before marriage for two reasons: 1. You don’t want to displease the Lord; 2. The emotional connection that comes with a physical relationship is extremely hard to get over if things don’t work out. If someone demands that you meet them alone at a private place, NEVER agree. If you have to meet, make sure that you meet them in a public place instead.</p>
					    <h3>Verify the Family Background Before Making a Commitment</h3>
					    <p>Refrain from committing to marriage without having a one-on-one meeting session with the family and relatives of the person you are interested in. Find out the details of their family and background. Visit the place they work. Make sure you do a thorough investigation before making any kind of a commitment. If a person avoids giving you the details of his or her family or workplace, distance yourself from them immediately.</p>
