					<h5 class="card-header">Mandatory Member Information for Recognition Purposes</h5>
					<div class="card-body">
						<p>Every time a client becomes a member of DoosriBiwi.com , certain information is asked to be used as identification information and to provide customized services to clients. The client’s contact information, email address, name, age, gender and residential information all fall under the general identification information category. Any general information is never disclosed to any third party without the permission of the client.</p>
						<p>If you remove your privacy settings at any time or share any confidential information with other members then the company cannot be held liable for the actions.</p>
						<p>No general information is sold, rented or shared under any circumstances. For premium membership at our Pakistan matrimony site, we do ask for the client’s credit card information for billing purposes and this critical information is kept private. No third party credit processors are used in order to eliminate the risk of privacy invasion and instead 128 bit encryption is used.</p>

					<h5 class="card-header">Requiring Personal and General Information</h5>
					<div class="card-body">
						<p>Any piece of privileged information that can verify a client’s identity comes under the label of ‘personal information’. The original name of a client, his credit card information and email address are deemed as personal information. Another category of information is requested from the client as part of the registration process that is called ‘general information for identification’. This type of client information will be used in order to provide superior quality customized services. Miscellaneous information such as contact information, credit card numbers for billing, financial information like expiry date of credit card, etc. is gathered only if the client signs up for a premium membership account.</p>
						<p>All financial information of clients is processed using our very own high encryption secure server instead of billing site owned by third party companies. The secure ‘https’ mode can be confirmed by the appearance of a bold icon in the address bar of the client’s browser at the starting of the address bar before Shaadi website address. It is important for members to understand that their billing information is only referred in case any premium service is availed by them.</p>
						<p>All private information provided to us is in no way rented, shared or sold to any third party organization. However, public information is intended for making available to other registered members. Such information that will appear for public viewing is the client’s name, age, gender, location, profession, etc.</p>
