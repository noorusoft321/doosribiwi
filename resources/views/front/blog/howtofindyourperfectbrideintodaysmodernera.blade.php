						Marriage is one of the biggest commitments of one’s life and you need to give it a great deal of consideration before making a final decision. Finding the right partner holds a lot of importance because if you make the wrong decision, your whole life will be no less than a nightmare. The opportunity to look for your perfect bride is the once-in-a-lifetime kind because you have to spend the rest of your life with her. Every single person on this planet is responsible for his or her future life and can lead their ‘happily ever after’ by making the right choices in their present. Choosing your perfect bride, one with whom you can lead a happily married life is easier said than done. There is a variety of things that need to be kept in mind while making the decision. In this blog post, we discuss some of them.

						Today, it is common to see people complaining about the toxic relationships they have with their wives but they fail to realize the real reason behind them. Your relationship with your spouse suffers when you are unable to develop a connection with them – a feeling of mutual understanding and respect. It is important to look for someone you can connect with easily. And this doesn’t just mean having the same likes, dislikes, and interests such as reading or going on trips together. While this is important, as we will discuss later, what is more important is to have a mental connection. Your thoughts, your values, your principals, all should be in line with each other. As an example, if you would like your spouse to pray with you fives times a day, you should look for someone who already does that instead of forcing someone to pray once they become your wife. It is things like these that you have to consider on a very deep level.
						Another important thing to consider while looking for your soul mate is to make sure that you can strike an interesting conversation with them about anything and everything. This will ensure that you always have something to talk about, you don’t get bored of each other, and can genuinely enjoy each other’s company.

						Next, come interests and the ability to enjoy each other’s company. By finding someone who has similar interests to yours, chances are you would be more likely to enjoy the relationship, as well as the little things together! It is understandable that not everyone can have exactly the same interests as you but having at least two or three common hobbies can help in keeping the relationship going strong for all your years together! And with time, the number of similar interests can also see an increase as you both begin to enjoy the activities the other person indulges in.

						Given the choice, look for an intellectual woman rather than a beautiful woman. The smartness (and wittiness) of a girl goes a long way in a healthy relationship while physical beauty fades away with time. An educated and intellectual woman can prove to be a lot more suitable for her husband, as well as her in-laws since she is willing to learn and make some real progress in life. She is more likely to play a positive role in building a happy home for her family, not just economically but in the interpersonal or social aspects of life too. Also, an intellectual partner will have a better understanding of life and how to maneuver it, helping you make yours a whole lot better too.

						There’s no such thing as a ‘perfect’ human being – one who is seen as flawless by everyone. All human beings have flaws and qualities all at the same time. How one perceives or sees them is highly subjective. You must be able to see all the good qualities in your spouse that make her stand out from others. And once you have made the decision of marrying her, make sure you stick to it and accept her with all her flaws, weaknesses, and qualities that make her perfect for you in her own unique way.

					<p>
						The trickiest part is finding a life partner who respects you for who you are. We are all aware that love is blind and it makes us do everything for the person we love, even if they treat us badly. But that is not how it should be. Don’t let love be an excuse to allow someone to treat you poorly. It is quite obvious that nobody can stand to spend their entire life with someone who has no respect for them. When someone really listens to you, no matter what you have to say, that’s a sign of respect. When they speak well of you to others, that’s respect. When they treat your friends and family right, that’s respect. And the list goes on. Make sure that you choose a partner who is proud of you and who makes that obvious. Needless to say, respect is a two-way street and you have to treat her the same way as well.
						We hope and pray that you find the perfect bride for yourself and live a happy, blessed married life!
