						Gone are the days when people used to agree to a marriage proposal after a single glance at a picture of the prospect. Today, we are slowly moving on from such conservative trends. Nowadays, everyone wants to get married to the person they truly love – someone they know well. Many, however, are not able to find their soulmates on their own. This is not a big problem anymore, since Shaadi Organization, a registered and recognized Pakistani matrimony website, helps you find an ideal life partner with ease.
						We, at Shaadi Organization, arrange matchmaking events twice a year, where a large number of suitors can find their soulmates in the presence of their elders and with the help of our super-dedicated staff.
						How to Get Yourself Registered with Shaadi Organization
						Any marriage candidate who is willing to find the life partner of his/her choice is asked to visit our office before they can get themselves registered. In the meeting, the individual is asked many questions related to his or her family and life by our expert consultants as they try to get as much authentic personal information about them as they can. The moment our consultants become satisfied with the answers of the candidates, they are asked for their CNIC copy. The candidates are also asked to fill in a form with their personal information and take an oath that the information they are providing is based on facts.
						We then connect candidates with suitors that meet almost all their requirements and we keep on finding them potential matches until the individuals are fully satisfied. We also make sure that the personal information they provide is kept private until they are introduced to a marriage candidate they are interested in – we only reveal the personal information upon the candidate’s consent.
						Doosri Biwi has also held various matchmaking events where we became a helping hand to those interested in finding a soulmate to spend the rest of their lives with. With Allah’s help, we have always been quite successful in our efforts. For these events, we give free tickets to our registered members whereas the general public can also attend by obtaining the tickets from our office. The main purpose of these events is to ensure a one-to-one meeting between different families so that they can meet in person and determine whether they are a good match for each other.
						Let’s take a look at some of the events we have held in the past.
						Grand Annual Meeting
						This event was held in January 2016. A large number of well-known welfare organizations and brands collaborated with us to organize the event where we brought together a large number of people from different walks of life, including all of our respected clients and various other candidates, so they could find their soulmates with our assistance. The event facilitated meetings between prospective life partners in a respectful setting, that too in the presence of their elders. This event was a massive success since a large number of people were able to find their partners and are now leading happy lives.
						3rd Grand Matchmaking Event in Pakistan
						Motto: Changing Perspectives
						The latest event that we arranged, ‘Grand Matchmaking Event,’ was held in January 2018 at Marriot Hotel Karachi. This was one of the best matchmaking events of all time. You must be wondering why? Well, we held it with the aim of changing perspectives. A large number of disabled people were invited to the event and we went out of our way to find them the partner of their choice in the presence of their elders. We tried to break the chains of backwardness by making people believe that disability has nothing to do with the nature or character of a person and that everyone has the right to get married and be happy.
						In the Eastern society where divorce is considered taboo, people refrain from getting married to divorcees but we tried to change this perspective too by finding matches for divorcees. We wanted them to believe that they can also spend their life as they desire and be happy like every other person. With Allah’s support, we became successful in achieving our goals.
						Shaadi Grand Matchmaking Event, July 2018
						Motto: New Beginnings
						Shaadi Organization is holding yet another matchmaking event that is going to be bigger and better than ever before! To be held on 8th July 2018, this event will gather a large number of people from different walks of life so they can search for like-minded partners to spend their lives with. We aim to become a part of the new beginnings of a large number of couples, with different welfare organizations and brands sponsoring our efforts. Our ultimate goal is to help people find their ‘happily ever after’ and this event is one way to achieve that goal. So don’t hesitate in joining us as we facilitate new beginnings and help create new bonds.
