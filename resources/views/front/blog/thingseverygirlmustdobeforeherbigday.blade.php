						Whether you are going to get married in the next couple of months or in a few weeks, you will find yourself running here and there till the very last moment because of the endless things on your to-do list. And you are not alone in this – almost everyone has to get through the hassle of completing tens of last-minute tasks in the days closest to their wedding. It is understandable if you are worried about how to plan your wedding so that when you walk down the aisle, you feel like the happiest – and prettiest – girl in the world. We don’t blame you for fantasizing way too much – every bride wants everything to be picture-perfect. And to turn this dream into reality, you need proper planning and well-placed efforts. To help you avoid any sort of last-minute distress on your special day, we have put together the ultimate wedding guideline for every bride-to-be. Make sure that you benefit from all these tips well in time so that your big day can be the happiest one of your life!
						Go for a New Hair Color
						Getting a hair makeover is not a bad idea but getting it right before your wedding can result in a complete disaster if something goes wrong. Why is it a good idea? Well, because it is just the kind of dramatic change that will complement the huge change about to occur in your life. But what if the color you go for doesn’t suit you? You should experiment with a new hair color at least a couple of months before the wedding day. If it works for you, you can get a touch-up right before your wedding or, if you don’t like it, you can go for another option.
						Take Care of Your Eating Habits
						Let’s face it – getting all the preparations done for your wedding is a stressful task. You have to deal with multiple things during this time and since you are likely balancing your work life along with such a huge responsibility, your hectic routine can spiral out of control. In such a scenario, your health can take a hit. The best thing you can do to make sure everything goes well and your well-being doesn’t suffer is to start adopting a healthy diet so that you can stay fit and strong during this stressful time. Eating and drinking right will be helpful in many ways. Eating the right foods will help you maintain your energy levels, as well as your weight while drinking lots of water will not only keep you hydrated, but will also play a vital role in bringing out a natural glow on your skin. Water has no match when it comes to enhancing your entire look so drink lots, no matter what!
						Get a Teeth-Whitening Treatment
						Let your smile tell a story on your big day and don’t shy away from grinning wide and bright. And for that, it is extremely important for you to have bright and white teeth. Your smile makes all the difference – if you smile with confidence on your special day, you will look back at all the pictures and memories fondly. To make your wedding day a perfect one, make sure that you visit a dentist a month before it so that you can get a teeth-whitening treatment done. It will, without a doubt, bring out the shine in your smile.
						Get Rid of Acne
						Acne is the bane of every girl’s life. Nobody can understand the pain of a girl who is about to get married and all is going well but acne breaks out on her face at the last moment. Treat your skin right by taking care of it before the wedding. Indulge in a dermatologist-approved skin care regime and drink lots and lots of water. If you still end up suffering at the hands of acne, choose extremely safe, natural, and healthy options to get rid of the breakout in no time. Avoid never-tried-before facials and other treatments and choose natural all the way. Make sure you do not neglect your day-to-day skin care routine so that you can have absolutely flawless and glowing skin by the time your wedding day arrives.
						Take Time Out for Yourself
						The last thing you need to do before tying the knot is to take out some quality time for your own self. While the rest of the tips were mainly to enhance your appearance, this one is for your mind and is the most important one. All the happenings and preparations before your wedding and rushing here and there like a crazy person can take its toll on you. Take time out for yourself before the wedding madness begins so you can feel better, both physically and mentally. Spend plenty of time getting all the necessary services from the beauty salon. Do the things you love. Maybe even take a trip! Don’t allow yourself to get stressed out over petty things that did not work out the way you were expecting. Believe it or not, you will thank yourself later, because they don’t matter more than you! Focus on you and ensure that you’re genuinely happy as you step into a new phase of your life.
						While there are hundreds of things one needs to do before their wedding day, these five tips can help you look and feel great on the biggest day of your life. Keep them in mind and stop stressing out, because all will be well.
