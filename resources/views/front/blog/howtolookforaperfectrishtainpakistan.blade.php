						‘You have completed your education and now it’s high time you got married,’ says every mother when a Pakistani girl accomplishes her top-priority goals that she had set as a kid – graduating university or finding her place in the corporate world among other possibilities. It is the time when a girl’s mother starts looking for perfect rishtas for her daughter. This reaction of a mother comes as no surprise because the thought that the best time to get married is right after completing one’s education has been inculcated in our minds since the day we were born. If your daughter has reached the age of marriage but you don’t know where to find a good rishta for her, you are not alone; this is a problem many people face. Here is a list of things that will help you find the perfect Rishta in Pakistan for your love.

						It is perfectly fine to go to your relatives first and tell them that you are looking for a rishta for your daughter. There’s nothing wrong with telling your relatives that your daughter is ‘of age’ and you are on a hunt for a nice guy who has a good family background for your beloved daughter. This way, anyone from your family who may have someone in mind will come forward and make their interest apparent.
						Unlike the general perception of the society, asking your relatives yourself does not lessen your respect or worth in any way. You should not feel embarrassed when it comes to asking for help in that regard since it is your duty as a parent to do everything possible to get your daughter married to a person who she deserves – one who truly possesses great qualities that set him apart from most other people.

						A large number of people in Pakistan find their soul mates in marriage events. These events are a great opportunity to mingle with people from different families and start a conversation to find out whether you have something in common or not. Nothing can be better than taking your daughter along with you to such events so that she can meet the person who may be her future spouse and his family and make a decision based on her likes and dislikes. What you can do in such a situation is to facilitate the process and make it as easy as possible for your daughter. Make sure she initiates a conversation with a decent family that you have a feeling will be good for her. She might feel a little awkward at first but she’ll get comfortable after a while. If both parties seem willing, the guy’s side will send a proposal and everything will move forward.

						You will come across Rishta aunties everywhere who are known for bringing in different proposals through word of mouth. You can consider getting in touch with a reliable one as they will go out of their way to hook you up with a family that meets all your requirements. These women will hand you plenty of pictures of different suitors and will arrange several meetings with the families of suitors so that you can meet the families in person and get to know them. You can then make a final decision after meeting a few of the suitors. Every girl has to go through such rishta-seeking processes to find her Mr. Perfect. The guy in consideration should be investigated by the elder members of the family and his proposal should be accepted only after a lot of consideration and the mutual agreement of the entire family.

						Another way to look for a perfect rishta for your daughter is through authentic matrimonial sites where you can get your daughter registered by just filling up an online form. This form requires the marriage candidate’s personal information which is kept private. Authentic matrimonial sites consider it their primary responsibility to keep the candidates’ profiles secure and maintain confidentiality. After getting your daughter registered, browse through a number of profiles and shortlist some people based on the choices of your interest. These matrimonial sites aim to give you effective customer care services so that you can find a perfect match for your daughter in a short span of time.
