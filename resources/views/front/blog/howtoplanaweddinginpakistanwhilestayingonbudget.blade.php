						Most of us dream of a fancy, luxurious, and glamorous wedding since it is the most important day of our lives and we cherish the memories that we make on this day, forever. It is to be kept in mind, though, that if you go for your dream wedding, chances are you might end up in debt very soon. In Pakistan, where the majority of the population belongs to the middle class, a wedding, being an extravagant affair for most, uses up all the savings of a family. It costs a significant amount of money for just one day, but families have to spend this money, even if they don’t have it, simply to save face.
						This is why, from the day a girl is born, families start saving up and gathering different household items, gold jewelry that belongs to the girl’s mother or grandmother, and even clothes, so that these items can be presented to their daughter on her big day as a wedding gift. But still, when the time of the wedding arrives, they realize that they still have so much to buy and so much to do and that is where the real trouble actually begins for the parents.
						While some expenses are inevitable, there are some ways in which you can reduce costs considerably. Here are a few tips that can help you plan your wedding while keeping the cost to a minimum.
						1- Plan Everything Out First
						If you want to plan an exquisite wedding without going broke, then you need to focus on planning ahead. Make a list of everything you can think of that needs to be done so that you know which things to do when and how. The earlier you start planning, the less last-minute stress you will have to deal with. This way, you will get more time to research affordable boutiques to get your bridal wear from, the salons that perfectly fit your budget, and venues that offer you discounts if you book early. Another advantage of starting the preparation before time is that you’ll get your hands on items from sales and through early-bird discounts.
						2- Get Things Organized
						Getting organized is not easy, especially with so many things that need to be taken care of. If you want your big day to feel like one straight out of a fairytale, consider using technology to get things done. Devise a budget breakdown, list down all important tasks or draft your guest list using a Word or Excel document or a Google spreadsheet. This will help a great deal in getting all the details in one place.
						3- Choose the Venue
						The wedding dates are usually fixed a long time in advance, maybe even a year before the actual day. The best thing about fixing the wedding date this early is that you can visit a large number of venues including lawns, marquees, and banquet halls, and then select the one that suits your needs best while also staying within your budget. Another benefit, as mentioned above, is that many wedding venue providers offer great discounts on making a booking a couple of months in advance.
						4- Compile the Guests’ List
						Before booking the banquet, take out some time to list down the names of everyone you want to invite to celebrate the best day of your life with you. Keep your guests’ list limited and try to invite your immediate family members, close relatives, and friends from both the bride and groom’s side. Avoid inviting people you have no acquaintance with and also decide who to invite with their families and who to invite alone. The guests’ list will help you determine how much you will have to spend on meals and arrangements, based on the number of people attending.
						5- Create the Perfect Bridal Dress
						When it comes to buying your bridal dress, girls want an exquisite attire with extraordinarily magnificent details so they feel nothing less than a princess on their big day. And if the dress that they have imagined in their head does not become a reality, the disappointment is unmatchable. Again, it is better to start early and look for designers who can recreate your imaginary gown in the best way. It is also always better to go for replicas because designer dresses are unaffordable for most.
						6- Make Catering Decisions Wisely
						Catering is something that should not be ignored at any cost. Food is an essential part of any event, and should always be top-quality. Your guests will ignore everything else but when it comes to food, they will be disappointed if the menu they are served is not up to the mark. In order to save money without compromising on the quality and taste, try to go simple and select dishes that are loved by everyone. After all, 2 delicious items are much better than 10 not-so-tasty ones.
						7- Avoid Making Hasty Decisions
						Do not book a florist or a photographer after the first meeting – chances are you will come across much better service providers if you look for longer and compare the services and prices in more detail. Sometimes, making quick decisions can cause problems – avoid rushing into decisions in order to experience an amazingly wonderful event, that too without putting a hole in your pocket.
