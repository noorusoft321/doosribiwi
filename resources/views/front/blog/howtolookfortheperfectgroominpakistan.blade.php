						Every girl dreams about her big day and her future husband from a very young age. In the process, she develops a checklist of qualities that he should possess. It is believed by many males in the Pakistani society that women have an unattainable checklist of traits and things that they look for in their future grooms, but that is not the case. Women just look for the small things that would make them happy and make their bond with their spouse stronger. It will probably not come as a surprise to you that women do not usually fall for physical appearance, rather, they value the overall personality of a man.
						If you are a young woman in Pakistan looking to get married, here are some things that you should look for in your future groom. These things are obviously not set in stone and are just for the sake of giving you an idea of the traits you should look for in your better half.

						Genuineness and commitment to the marriage are of utmost importance in a spouse. If you are looking for the perfect groom in Pakistan, you should opt for someone who is sincere and would show immense commitment to the marriage. No matter what part or city of Pakistan you are living in, your choice of finding a perfect partner should be based on the honesty and commitment of a person. The person who you are thinking of marrying should be able to respect the institution of marriage and should be all geared up to make a lifelong commitment. Women generally fall for men who go out of their way to maintain a healthy and happy married life until the very end, no matter what life chooses to throw their way!
						Now, you must be wondering how you can know for sure if a man is sincere or ready to make any kind of commitment. Well, it is not that difficult! You’ll get the answer simply by observing his actions, the way he behaves and most importantly by carefully observing his deeds. Determine if he is a man of his words, i.e. if he breaks his promises or not. The commitment and honesty of a person speak volumes about their character.

						The most important factor in finding a perfect groom is to look for someone who can make you laugh anytime and anywhere. Life is not perfect; there will be hard times, challenges, and pain that you will have to go through. Your heart will break, you will have to encounter defeat, and you will lose your loved ones. There will be moments when you will find yourself in despair and you will be questioning your existence – in all such situations, you will need someone by your side who can make you laugh when you don’t even feel like smiling.
						Find yourself a partner who has a similar sense of humor to yours; who can crack jokes at the worst times to make you feel better; someone who will turn your bad days into good ones just by telling a funny story; someone who you can be crazy with; and most importantly, someone who makes you feel alive every day and gives you a reason to live your life to the fullest.
						Life is too short and tough to adjust with someone who does not even know how to give your mood a boost or how to brighten up your days. Sometimes, all you need is to look for someone who can make you laugh out loud with his silly jokes.

						We all know that marriages in Pakistan can often take on a Star-Plus quality. What starts as a minor disagreement between family members can escalate into a full-fledged war in a matter of a few days. In any such situations, it is extremely important that your husband be cooperative – he needs to listen to your side of the story and stand up for you when you are in the right. This applies to situations inside the home, as well as outside. While he should (gently) correct you when you are at fault, he should be fully supportive when you are right. All in all, he should be your support system against all odds.

						It would not be wrong to say that the only permanent thing in your life is ‘change.’ Not every day in your life will be the same – every sunrise will bring your way new challenges, different situations, and new problems. Find someone who is ready to deal with all these challenges and problems with his emotional maturity and calmness. When you look for the perfect groom for yourself, make sure that you look for core qualities like confidence, maturity, integrity, and competence so that you can lead the happy life that you have always wished for.

					<p>
						Let’s be realistic – your marriage will not last for long if your future husband is not financially stable or does not have the determination to reach the top or at least earn enough money to run the household and to fulfill your basic needs and desires (if you are a housewife and don’t earn for yourself). We are not saying that an ideal man can only be one who earns a six-figure salary. He does not necessarily need to be wealthy, but it is important to look for someone who earns well and is a good financial planner so that he can give quality education to your children and make their future better and more secure, while also fulfilling all your basic needs so that you can live the life of your dreams.
						While there are hundreds of other things to take into consideration while choosing someone to spend the rest of your life with, these are some of the things that will ensure that you lead a content life full of joy, laughter, and a lot of love and support.
