						Expecting too much can make the lives of both partners depressed. Your partner may feel that he/she is not enough for you and this is the point from where conflicts arise. Communication is the best way of understanding what your partner can do, so check your expectations and make sure that they are not too high.
						Always thinking and saying that you are right cannot do any good but instead will increase the misunderstandings. Try to understand the perspective of one another and be ready to make compromises in a heartbeat.

						Don’t compare your life to others if you are not aware of the circumstances the other person has faced.
						Not everyone in the life has everything. There is some lacking. That is why the comparing your life with another is the worst thing you will ever do. It’s been rightly said that:
						‘Comparison is a death of joy’
						If you spend time thinking about what others have and what you don’t have, then you can never live a fulfilled life. Your sadness ultimately affects your spouse, along with the rest of your family. Focus on what you have and you’ll attain happiness in no time.
